				<p>
					A mass balance is an engineering technique where one applies the <em>law of conservation of mass</em> on a physical
					system to determine new information from it. So what is the law of conservation of mass?
				</p>
				<blockquote class="remove-background-color">
					The law of conservation of mass states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter and energy, the mass of the
					system must remain constant over time &hellip;
					<strong style="color:white">The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed.</strong>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					From this infomation we can conclude that any mass flowing <em>IN</em> a system must be <em>ACCUMULATED</em> or flow
					<em>OUT</em> of said system. This can be consicely defined by the following equation: &nbsp;
					<katex expression=" \mathrm{IN} = \mathrm{OUT} + \mathrm{ACC}"></katex>
				</p>
				<p>
					A mass balance applies this law to a physical system by analyzing all its <em>input</em> streams and <em>output</em>					streams. Lets start with a simple example, a 2D Box (the "system") with 1 ball flowing <em>in</em> and <em>out</em>.

						<p>In this example, an orange ball is entering the blue box at a <em>rate</em> of 1 ball per second, or 1 ball/s. The
							orange ball is also leaving at 1 ball/s. We can express this with a mass balance equation as follows:</p>

							<p>In this example you can change the <em>rate</em> at which the orange balls enter and leave the blue box. You can adjust
								this rate up to 5 ball/s. </p>
							<p>Notice how the orange balls will <em>accumulate</em> in the blue box if the <em>IN</em> rate is greater than the <em>OUT</em>							rate </p>

				<p>So far we have only dealt with only one type of ball (color) in our system.  However, what if there are mutliple types of balls?
					How can we leverage and use the mass balance we have learned above for this new system?
				</p>
				<p>
					We will see that for <em>each</em> type of ball, a mass balance is created. Concretely, if there are two colors of balls, orange and green,
					then there will be two mass balance equations.

					<p>with a final equation being the summation of the two above</p>

					Using this information we will construct the next example where a system has two <em>input</em> streams with distinct colors and
