          A mass balance is an engineering technique where one applies the <em>law of conservation of mass</em> on a physical system to determine new information from it.
          So what is the law of conservation of mass?
        </p>
        <blockquote class="remove-background-color">
          The law of conservation of mass or principle of mass conservation states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter and energy, 
          the mass of the system must remain constant over time &hellip;
          <strong style="color:white">The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed.</strong>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          A Mass Balance applies this law to a physical system by analyzing all its <em>input</em> streams and <em>output</em> streams. Lets start with a simple example. A 2D Box with balls flowing <em>in</em>
          and <em>out</em>.
